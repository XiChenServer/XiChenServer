# My LSM Tree-based KV Database

![Project Logo](path_to_your_logo.png)

## Overview

This project is a highly efficient key-value database designed and implemented using an LSM (Log-Structured Merge) tree structure. It is optimized for write-heavy workloads, ensuring fast data storage and retrieval.

### Key Features

- **LSM Tree Structure**: Ensures efficient data storage and retrieval, particularly in write-heavy scenarios.
- **Key-Value Separation**: Implements key-value separation to optimize the storage and retrieval of large objects.
- **gRPC Communication**: Utilizes gRPC for remote procedure calls, enhancing the scalability and flexibility of the system.
- **Bloom Filter Integration**: Integrates a Bloom filter for rapid existence checks, reducing unnecessary disk access and improving query performance.
- **Persistence & Crash Recovery**: Implements Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) to ensure data safety and reliability in case of system failures.
- **Memory Management**: Optimizes memory usage with an LRU (Least Recently Used) caching strategy to improve system performance.
- **Data Compression**: Incorporates data compression techniques to minimize storage space usage and enhance storage efficiency.
